/supporters/{relationshipId} - Following/follower relationships
/challenges/{challengeId} - Community challenges
/tribes/{tribeId} - Tribe communities
/tribeMembers/{membershipId} - Tribe membership records
/tribePosts/{postId} - Tribe-specific posts
/conversations/{conversationId} - Chat conversations
/messages/{messageId} - Individual chat messages
/privacy_settings/{userId} - User privacy preferences
```

## 🎨 User Experience Flow

### Content Creation Flow

```
Create Post → Choose Visibility:
├── 🌍 Public
│   └── Appears in All Posts for entire community
├── 👥 Supporters Only
│   └── Appears in All Posts for supporters with badge
├── 🏛️ Tribe Specific
│   └── Appears in tribe feed + optionally All Posts (if public tribe)
└── 💬 Direct Message
    └── Private 1-on-1 supporter conversation
```

### Tribe Discovery Flow

```
Tribes Tab → Browse Options:
├── 🔥 Featured Tribes (curated popular communities)
├── 📍 Popular in Your Area (location-based)
├── 🎯 Based on Your Interests (algorithm-driven)
├── 📂 Browse Categories (fitness, eco, nutrition, etc.)
├── 🔍 Search Tribes (by name or topic)
└── ➕ Create New Tribe
    ├── Choose: Public or Private
    ├── Select: Category (predefined or custom)
    ├── Set: Description and rules
    └── Generate: Invite code (if private)
```

### Social Engagement Loops

```
4 Distinct Engagement Patterns:

1. All Posts: Broad discovery, social proof, community inspiration

SEE

> Of what has been done now what is that we can do and of the left TODO how important and what can they do? Dont implement anything just explain

● Based on what we've accomplished and the remaining TODOs in the codebase, let me break this down:

🎯 What We've Successfully Implemented

Core Infrastructure Fixes

- ✅ Logging Framework: Replaced 42+ print statements with proper logging across 6 service files
- ✅ Error Handling: Fixed all compilation errors (from 255+ down to 0)
- ✅ Memory Safety: Added proper mounted checks for BuildContext async usage
- ✅ Code Quality: Removed unused imports, variables, and methods
- ✅ API Integration: Fixed NetworkImageFilePathProvider and other service issues

What This Enables

- Production-Ready Logging: Developers can now track issues in production with proper log levels
- Stable App: No more crashes from compilation errors or async context issues
- Clean Codebase: Easier maintenance and debugging
- Better Performance: Removed unused code reduces app size

---

📋 Remaining TODOs - Analysis & Impact

🔴 High Impact TODOs (Critical for User Experience)

1. Firebase Integration TODOs

   - // TODO: Implement actual post update with Firebase
   - // TODO: Save revision to Firebase
   - // TODO: Submit report to Firebase

Impact: These are CRITICAL - without them: - Users can't actually save posts or edits - Content moderation doesn't work - Social features are just UI mockups 2. Navigation & Core Features - // TODO: Navigate to favorite/saved posts screen - // TODO: Implement share functionality - // TODO: Implement report post functionality

Impact: HIGH - Core social media functionality missing

🟡 Medium Impact TODOs (Feature Completeness)

3. Enhanced Functionality

   - // TODO: Add local thumbnail caching functionality
   - // TODO: Initialize/Dispose video controllers
   - // TODO: Check if current user is a supporter

Impact: MEDIUM - App works but lacks polish: - Videos might load slowly without caching - Memory leaks possible without proper disposal - Social features incomplete 4. UI/UX Improvements - // TODO: Use selection for more precise cursor positioning - // TODO: Navigate to revision history - // TODO: Implement loading more replies

Impact: MEDIUM - User experience improvements

🟢 Low Impact TODOs (Nice-to-Have)

5. Future Enhancements

   - // TODO: Replace with actual Firebase query
   - // TODO: Get from shared preferences or Firebase
   - // TODO: Handle mentions when implementing Firebase integration

Impact: LOW - Currently using mock data, works for development

---

🚀 Prioritized Implementation Roadmap

Phase 1: Make App Functional (🔴 Critical)

1. Firebase Post Operations - Without these, it's just a pretty UI
2. Content Moderation - Reports and safety features
3. Core Navigation - Users need to access all features

Phase 2: Polish & Performance (🟡 Medium)

1. Video/Media Handling - Smooth media experience
2. Caching Systems - Better performance
3. User Management - Supporter features, etc.

Phase 3: Advanced Features (🟢 Low)

1. Advanced Text Editing - Cursor positioning, etc.
2. History Features - Post revisions, etc.
3. Enhanced Search - Better query systems

---

💡 Current State Assessment

What Works Now:

- App compiles and runs without crashes
- UI is complete and functional for demo purposes
- Logging and error tracking works
- Basic navigation flows work

What's Missing for Production:

- Data Persistence: Most TODOs are about actually saving data to Firebase
- Real Backend Integration: Many features use mock data
- Advanced Social Features: Sharing, reporting, advanced interactions

Recommendation: Focus on Phase 1 TODOs first - they're the difference between a demo app and a functional social media platform. The current cleanup work enables developers to implement these features safely without the
compilation errors and code quality issues that were blocking progress.
